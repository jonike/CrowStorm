## Configure and test crow install

Tested on: x64 gcc 5.4.0 20160609 (Ubuntu 5.4.0-6ubuntu1~16.04.4)

### cmake (v3.5.1)
~~~~
sudo apt-get install cmake
~~~~

### tmalloc (v4.X)
~~~~
sudo apt-get install google-perftools
~~~~

Cmake expects the library to be named "libtcmalloc.so" exactly, pop in symlink:  
~~~~
sudo ln -s /usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so.4.2.6 /usr/lib/libtcmalloc.so
~~~~

### openssl (v1.0.2g)
~~~~
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev
~~~~

### boost (v1.58.0)
~~~~
sudo apt-get install libboost-all-dev
~~~~

### libcurl (v?)
~~~~
sudo apt-get install libcurl4-gnutls-dev
~~~~


### crow (v?)

*NOTE* crow and CrowStorm should be cloned into the same parent directory as CrowStorm relies on the relative path ../crow

~~~~
git clone https://github.com/ipkn/crow
~~~~

You should now have everything you need to compile the crow server/example/tests:

~~~~
cd crow
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..

100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 2

Total Test time (real) =   0.44 sec
~~~~

You should have been able to compile 100% and run the tests 100%. If this was NOT the case, make sure to consult the crow documentation until all dependencies are satisfied before moving on.

## Compile and test the crow_storm application

Assuming you are still located in the crow/build directory perform the following commands:

~~~~
cd ../../
git clone https://github.com/rockhowse/CrowStorm
cd CrowStorm
~~~~

### Example usage

~~~~
make clean

rm -f crow_storm
rm -f crow_storm_d

make
g++ -o crow_storm crow_storm.cpp -std=c++14 -O3 -lboost_system -lboost_thread -lboost_filesystem -lboost_date_time -lpthread -lcurl
~~~~

If this process completes without errors, all the dependencies are comfigured correctly and you should be rdy to start up the crow_storm server!

#### Server Side
~~~~
./crow_storm 

(2017-03-19 03:07:51) [INFO    ] Crow/0.1 server is running, local port 18080
(2017-03-19 03:07:51) [DEBUG   ] Connection open, total 1, 0x2133ef0
~~~~

You should now be able to open up your browser and connect to your local CrowStorm server on port 18080.

* [http://localhost:18080](http://localhost:18080) - local CrowStorm server

The server downloads and caches the list of companies and symbols from Nasdaq's site on startup. You can validate these files were created by navigating to the data/ directory inside the CrowStorm project.

cd data
ls -alh

~~~~

#### Client Side

### Home Page

When you first connect, you should be greeted with a simple interface with directions on how to access the OHLC and volume data for the past 30 days:

![CrowStorm ~ Home](http://rockhowse.com/projects/CrowStorm/CrowStorm-Home.png)

### Dynamic Search

CrowStorm uses async AJAX requests to update the top 5 most relavant searches by company name so as you type you should see the list update dynamically. Here you can see "appl" has been typed and the interface includes 5 companies whoes names start with what has been typed.

![CrowStorm ~ Search](http://rockhowse.com/projects/CrowStorm/CrowStorm-Search.png)

### OHLC And Volume Graphs

Once you have found the company and symbol to your liking, select the symbol and a graph showing the last 30 days worth of data should show up immediately. In this image, the symbol "AAPL" was selected. 

![CrowStorm ~ Select](http://rockhowse.com/projects/CrowStorm/CrowStorm-Select.png)

In the instance where a company has multiple symbols, ALL symbols for that company remain visible and the current graph remains "active" so you can quickly switch between any symbols for a specific company.

## Potential Enhancements

1. Robust security ~ currently it does minimal URL/input validation/scrubbing. Popping in a framework like OWASP would make it more secure.
2. Refactor for OO ~ the current server design is more functional than Object Oriented. The content type, symbol lookup and data acquisition could be moved to their own objects
3. Optimizations   ~ Ideally, company/symbol data would be placed into a local data store with pre-coverted and indexed data instead of re-computing it on every request. Also the static file route should use streaming instead of reading the entire artifact into memory before returning to support large artifacts.
4. User Prefereces ~ The results for the quick query are limited to 5 and the number of days of history are set at 30, these could easilby be added as client side parameters.
